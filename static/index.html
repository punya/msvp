                                Mapping Sexual Violence is a website that emerged out of an <a href="http://www.outofprintmagazine.in">Out of Print</a> initiative to produce an anthology featuring fiction and non-fiction writing on sexual violence in South Asia. The editors of the special issue – Meena Kandasamy, Samhita Arni and Indira Chandrasekhar – recognised that this effort needs to extend beyond the literary community. Meena proposed the idea of a map that records stories of sexual violence from across the country and the region. The purpose, to provide a platform to document silent voices, voices that have been unable to share their stories.

                                <a href=".">Mapping Sexual Violence</a> is intended to be a collective resource. It is meant for its users to use as a platform to share their stories, to build a network resource and a community.

Gratitude, also, to numerous other friends, conversations with whom helped hone ideas and create this place.
